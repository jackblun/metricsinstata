This is a short (and incomplete!) course teaching several applied econometric methods in Stata. The course is currently divided into 4 short guided tutorials, which are best done in sequence. Click on each section below to access the tutorial.

1. [Introduction to Stata](docs/part1/part1.html)
2. [Exploring and cleaning data](docs/part2/part2.html)
3. [Plotting data](docs/part3/part3.html)
4. [Randomized experiments and t-tests](docs/part4/part4.html)

For the econometric concepts, see either Imbens and Rubin (2015) or Angrist and Pischke (2008).

No coding experience is required. All datasets used are publicly available, so I would suggest running through each section, copying and running the code for yourself.

Each tutorial was created using the excellent [Stata Markdown](https://data.princeton.edu/stata/markdown), developed by Germán Rodríguez.

This course is designed by Jack Blundell
